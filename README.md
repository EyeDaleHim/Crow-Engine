# REWRITE GOALS

The plan is to create a proof-of-concept project of trying to create a modding system without relying on scripting. There will still be scripting but the main priority is still modding without scripting as much as possible.

    <summary><h2>Building Instructions</h2></summary>
    <p>Select the platform you want to compile on and follow the instructions.</p>
<details>
    <summary><h3>Windows</h3></summary>

1. Install the latest version of [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/).

3. Wait for the installer to install any necessary information.
4. Once everything has installed, select the `Individual components` tab.
5. Select these two components:
    - MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.29-16.11)
    - Windows 10/11 SDK (Any Version)
6. Hit install and wait for the components to install. Once finished, close out of the build tools.
7. Download and install [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Do not change any installation options, just leave them as is.
8. Navigate to and open your Crow Engine folder. Once in the folder, double-click the `update.bat` file to open it and install the necessary libraries to compile the engine.
9. After the libraries have been installed, the command prompt should close. Next, click the `File` button at the top-left of your screen. Select `Open Windows PowerShell`.
10. In the PowerShell window, type `lime build windows` and hit enter. This will start building the game. This will also take a bit of time if you are compiling for the first time.
11. Navigate to `export/release/windows/bin` to find and open the executable.
    - If you want to save yourself some time, run `lime test windows` in the prompt to open the game right after compilation.
